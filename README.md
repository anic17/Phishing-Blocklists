# Phishing Blocklists

Stop phishing before the click! A compiled list of various phishing sites I have come across. Add these to a blocklist and automatically stop phishing before users even have a chance to click.

## About

After spending some time on Discord, I've noticed a lot of various phishing schemes. Most of these come in the form of a bot spamming channels to try and get someone to click a link. This project serves as a blocklist of community compiled links you can add to a Discord bot to automatically ban phishing attempts before they occur.

## You can help!

Leave a pull request for **any** sites you come across. If there's not a preexisting folder, create a new one for the platform it's phishing.
